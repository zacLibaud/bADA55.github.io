# Introduction

Hit musical numbers from the blockbuster movies ‘Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge’ and ‘Titanic’ 
continue to occupy a special place in people’s hearts even today. This might make you think: 
What are the secret ingredients of music that enrapture all of us and how does it add magic 
to the movies? With this thought in mind, we will use the CMU Movie Summary Corpus and our 
Spotify Dataset to find out the dominant music attributes (danceability, energy, liveness, etc.) 
in different countries across the world so as to possibly reveal country-specific music styles for 
the top 3 countries (in our combined movie and music dataset). Subsequently, we will observe the change 
in music features and their interplay with the changes in the emotions portrayed by movies in the top 2 
countries (in our combined movie, music and emotion dataset) across the years. Finally, we will connect 
all the dots to reveal how music moves movies towards success. Let's dive deep into the world of music and movies!
