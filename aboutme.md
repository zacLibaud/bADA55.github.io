## Who are we? 

We are bADA55 (read it as you can)! A team formed for the occasion, during a very cold winter semester in Lausanne, who present here their discoveries in the form of a story. Here's a little more about each member of the group.

**Zoé Monnard - The Robust Porter:**
Zoé is our mainstay. She does an impressive job, always there to support the team. Like a porter, she's sturdy and reliable, and brings that dose of comfort that gives strength in hard times.

**Francois Goybet - The Barleywine:**
François is our code architect, the brains behind our structures. Like a barleywine, he's powerful, thoughtful and built to last. His complex ideas give depth and character to our project.

**Zacharie Libaud - The Artisan Pilsner:**
Meticulous and precise, Zacharie is like an artisanal Pilsner: a model of balance and finesse. Every detail is carefully thought out, and nothing is left to chance, just like this beer, which demands absolute precision in its brewing.

**William Schmid - The Triple IPA:**
William, our clustering pro, likes to push the boundaries. Like a triple IPA, he juggles intensities that can sometimes become explosive, especially when he pushes his computer to its limits. His passion for analysis is as strong as the bitterness of a good IPA.

**Pierre Tessier - The Experimental Season:**
Always ready to test a new method, Pierre is like an experimental saison beer: innovative, full of surprises, and always looking for the next big idea. He's the perfect embodiment of the spirit of exploration and adaptability.
